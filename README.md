   - Over-reliance on **Kevin De Bruyne** is a tactical and business risk (age, injury).  
   - Recommendation: recruit a **younger creative midfielder** as succession planning.  

4. **Unassisted Goals = Star Branding**  
   - High % of self-created goals adds to Haaland’s **marketability**.  
   - Position City to build the **global Haaland era** as a brand, following Messi/Ronaldo’s decline.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### Player Recruitment
- **Wide Playmakers** (elite crossers) → exploit Haaland’s aerial dominance (e.g., Kvaratskhelia, Leão).  
- **Creative Midfield Depth** → long-term De Bruyne successor (e.g., Wirtz, Musiala).  
- **Rotational Striker Partner** → flexible second striker/false 9 for tactical variety.  

### Tactical Adjustments
- Increase **early service patterns** to boost first-half scoring.  
- Manage pressing workload to keep him fresh for key finishing moments.  

### Business Opportunities
- Market Haaland’s “**clutch scoring moments**” in campaigns.  
- Build a **City-Haaland global narrative** to maximize fanbase growth and commercial value.

## 📝 Lessons Learned

2. **Business Growth = Football Success**: His goals directly correlate with trophies and brand value.  
3. **Risk Management**: Over-reliance on one playmaker is dangerous both tactically and financially.  
4. **Future Sustainability**: A balanced squad ensures City stays dominant even if Haaland’s form dips.
