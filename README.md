# A Business Analytics Study on Erling Haaland’s Impact (Premier League 2022–23)

## Problem Statement
Erling Haaland’s debut season with Manchester City raised both footballing and business questions:  
- Can his scoring efficiency translate into **sustained dominance** for City?  
- How should the club **strategically build its squad** around his unique playing style?  
- What kind of players or tactics should be prioritized to maximize both **on-field success and financial ROI** (trophies, brand value, fan engagement)?  

This project goes beyond statistics, combining **sports analytics with business insights**, to evaluate Haaland’s impact and provide **forward-looking recruitment strategies**.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Understat (goals, assists, shot maps, match outcomes).  
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).  
- **Analysis Approach**:  
  - Goal distribution by minute intervals (timing advantage).  
  - Shot location mapping (positional style).  
  - Goal type breakdown (open play, penalties, set pieces).  
  - Assist provider analysis (key partnerships).  
  - Business interpretation of tactical findings for recruitment planning.

## Key Insights & Business Narrative

1. **Timing Advantage = Marketing Leverage**  
   - Haaland scores heavily in **post-halftime (60–69 mins) and early dominance phases (30–39 mins)**.  
   - This not only impacts results but creates **highlights at crucial TV broadcast times**, boosting City’s brand visibility and fan engagement.  

2. **Shot Profile = Need for Creators**  
   - 90%+ of his shots are within the penalty area (avg. distance: **11.7 yards**).  
   - He is a **pure penalty-box striker**, relying on supply.  
   - Business implication: City must **retain and acquire elite creators** (crossers + through-ball specialists) to sustain his output.  

3. **Assist Dependencies**  
   - Strong link with **Kevin De Bruyne**, followed by Foden and Grealish.  
   - **Risk factor**: over-dependence on De Bruyne (aging, injury-prone).  
   - Forward strategy: **recruit a younger midfielder/playmaker** to replicate/replace De Bruyne’s vision long-term.  

4. **Goal Type Distribution = Versatility**  
   - **67% from open play** → low reliance on penalties/set pieces.  
   - This stability makes Haaland a predictable revenue driver in terms of goals → trophies → commercial growth.  
   - Suggests City doesn’t need to overspend on set-piece specialists, but rather on **wide players with elite crossing ability**.  

5. **Unassisted Goals = Star Branding**  
   - A high % of “self-created” goals reinforces Haaland’s **individual superstar marketability**.  
   - Business benefit: greater merchandising and global fan pull.

## Strategic Recommendations (Business + Sporting)

1. **Player Recruitment**  
   - **Wide playmakers/crossers**: To exploit Haaland’s aerial/physical strengths (e.g., players like Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Rafael Leão).  
   - **Creative midfield depth**: A long-term replacement/apprentice for Kevin De Bruyne to ensure continuity (e.g., Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala).  
   - **Rotational striker partner**: A versatile second striker/false 9 option for tactical flexibility (e.g., João Félix-type profiles).  

2. **Tactical Adjustments**  
   - Increase **early service patterns** to allow him to score in opening minutes (currently underutilized).  
   - Rotate pressing responsibilities to keep him fresher for conversion moments.  

3. **Business Value Creation**  
   - Market Haaland’s **“clutch scoring”** (goals at critical moments) in branding campaigns.  
   - Build a global **City-Haaland narrative** as the new era of dominance (post-Messi/Ronaldo marketing vacuum).

## Lessons Learned
1. **Data-driven recruitment is critical**: Haaland’s efficiency is maximized only if the supporting cast fits his style.  
2. **Business growth aligns with football success**: His goal-scoring directly correlates with trophies and global fan engagement.  
3. **Risk management**: Over-reliance on specific creators is both a tactical and financial risk — necessitating forward planning.  
4. **Sustainability**: A balanced squad ensures City can maintain dominance even if Haaland’s form fluctuates.
